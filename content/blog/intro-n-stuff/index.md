title: Being a developer/designer hybrid
date: "2020-08-18"
description: This is a place to document my journey as a dev/designer hybrid (or UI/UX Developer, or whatever it is this week). I like living in the hybrid space because it blends my interests really well.

### What am I?

I code, I design, and have always approached my career as not being a particular "thing" but rather just doing the best I can with the tasks handed to me and having fun with the process.

I had career advice early on where a mentor told me to never box myself in to one set of skills or to **not say I don't do a particular thing** because I'm not x, y, or z. Now, that's not about ignoring the limits of your skillset (e.g., I cannot **stand**  creating middleware or database design so that's a hard pass) but I like design, and I like building things, so why not try to do both?

### The start

My career began back in 2011 when the modern web was still maturing and you started to see the UX discipline starting to emerge. Roles were being split into devoted teams that focused on design and engineering respectively. Clients started demanding applications over sites, single page web applications were the new hotness, and traditional software engineers began leaving their asp.net shops in favor of Javascript development.

I got started in content strategy, moved on to front-end development, honed in on my UX chops, and now blend the two in the federal government. I had great mentors from the OG dot-com days, and others who were fantastic designers and had long ago jumped from physical to web mediums.

### Observations

I feel fortunate I got in early enough to know the pains of having a site crap out in IE, writing JS before ES6, getting DOM calls to work across browsers, and the slog of making designs work within the confines of a CMS.

All the issues I've encountered always had a large enough base of people with the same problems in the past that there's always a stackoverflow question that solves my issue. This allows me to focus on the more important tasks at hand, such as satisfying client expectations and creating finely tuned/accessible web products.

Still, I sometimes feel at meetups and conferences that there's a growing number of folks new to the UX industry who aren't familiar with development concerns. I feel confident as a designer because I can code, so I can preemptively recognize if something is going to not jive when translated to code and recognize the limitations of browsers/devices.

**Designs inevitably need to be tweaked** once they're translated from mockup to code, which is why I try to make that jump as quick as possible for iterating and getting feedback. I can also deeply appreciate having more research to inform designs, and a better understanding of users needs.

Yet I wonder if something is lost with the growing separation between the two disciplines.

### My own conclusion

So I go back to what my mentor said, **don't box yourself in.** I know the limits of what I can do, and enjoy having a mixture of both disciplines in my workload. In addition I think more companies are calling for hybrids as a cost saving measure but also to have that level of insight on projects.

**Is that choice at a cost to expertise in one or the other?** Not sure. Still, I've never missed a deadline or had a technical issue I couldn't fix alongside a trusty devoted engineer. Maybe that's what a hybrid is good for, being well enough at a few things and knowing who to ask for help when it's needed.

And while this has worked for me, I realize it's not for everyone.
